title: CMCI - Composable Models for Compliant Interaction Control
---

With the advent of highly redundant robots with model-based computed
torque control, the specification of compliant behavior is
increasingly important to create interactions with humans like
cooperate pushing, carrying, walking, and with objects e.g. in
grasping, polishing, or deburring. The idea of the CMCI project is to
tackle the composition challenges that occur through the inevitable
interplay of control, sensing, and the mechanism that creates the
targeted compliant behavior, which is necessary to realize advanced
robotics systems. To this end, the project aims at providing
composable domain-specific (meta-)models to enable the specification
of compliant behavior and model-transformations to synthesize the
required motion control components, realizing the desired compliant
interaction tasks. Both, the modeling and synthesis aspects will be
realized in our workbench for modeling robot control architectures
"CoSiMA".
