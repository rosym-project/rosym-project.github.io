title: Vericomp - Verifiable Composition of Dynamics and Control Algorithms for Robot Motion
---

Generating robot motion is mandatory to accomplish a plenitude of tasks including free-space motion and contact-oriented interactions. To compute desired robot motions a composition of kinematics, dynamics and control algorithms is required. The composition for non-trivial tasks with predictable properties at the system-level remains challenging even though the individual algorithms are nowadays well understood. VERICOMP aims at enabling developers to make verifiable statements about compositions in the robot motion domain. In particular, the project will focus on the non-functional requirements (i.e. timing) in addition to the functional ones, since neglecting the timing properties and requirements of a control algorithm can lead to a highly unstable, unpredictable and dangerous behavior.
